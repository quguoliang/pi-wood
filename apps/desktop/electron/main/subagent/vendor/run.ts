/**
 * The run contract: the record, the facts an executor reports into it, and
 * the ending that settles it.
 *
 * The dispatcher (`runner.ts`) is the run record's only writer. An executor
 * never holds the record: it witnesses what the child did and reports facts —
 * a transcript message, a terminal transcript snapshot, a stderr chunk —
 * through the {@link RunReporter} this module defines, and resolves to a
 * {@link RunEnding}. The fold from facts to record lives here, beside
 * the record it writes, and the dispatcher is the only module that invokes
 * it. Usage, fold-derived activity, and the per-message model are computed in
 * the fold, while live activity remains a separate ephemeral report, so a
 * terminal snapshot heals any drift the streamed facts accumulated.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0010-run-endings.md and docs/adr/0005-executor-reports-facts.md.
