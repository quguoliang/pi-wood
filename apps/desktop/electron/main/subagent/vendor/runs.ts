/**
 * The run registry: the set of subagent runs that exist right now.
 *
 * A run used to exist only as a `SingleResult` closed over by one dispatcher
 * call and pushed at one consumer, the host's tool renderer. Nothing could
 * enumerate runs, so nothing else could show them. This module owns that set
 * instead, and everything that displays or acts on runs reads it. The
 * dispatcher is the only module that adds runs; the delivery module is the
 * only one that releases them.
 *
 * A run lives here from start until its completion notification lands. At that
 * point the conversation names the run and the registry's display job is done.
